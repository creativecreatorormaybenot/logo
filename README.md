# logo

The most basic way of drawing the Flutter logo in Flutter.

Everything necessary (no dependencies, no assets) can be found in [`lib/main.dart`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/logo/blob/master/lib/main.dart).

## What is this

This is a demonstration of the **raw layer** in Flutter.
